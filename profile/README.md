## 🔧 Validating service

`TC Network` had joined to many Cosmos blockchain projects as mainnet and testnet validator role. We help to improve the network decentralization, security and scalability.

- Mainnet: EVMOS, Nomic, Gravity Bridge,  Rebus, Desmos, Galaxy, Idep, Dig...
- Testnet: Aura, MUN, HyperSign, OKP4, Defund, Quicksilver, Crescent...

We're running on multiple dedicated servers from different cloud providers for maximum reliability and security. And using Grafana, Prometheous and other tools to help us monitoring and alerting.

## 🎁 Staking Service

The first service we are support to Cosmos community is our staking UI. This service allows user/investor not only staking their coin but also tracking on-chain transactions with nice and good performance.

👉 Current we supported EVMOS and Rebus chains:

- [EVMOS staking](https://evmos.tcnetwork.io)

We will expanding the number of chains we are going to support by time.
