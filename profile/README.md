- Testnet: Aura, Defund, MUN, Ollo, Gitopia, HyperSign, Nibiru, Quicksilver, Crescent...

👉 We're running on multiple dedicated servers from different cloud providers for maximum reliability and security.

- Providing helpful scripts for setting up node, installing auto compound service. For detail please check [here](https://github.com/tcnetworkio/validator.tcnetwork.io).
- Monitoring node and validator with Grafana, Prometheous, Cosmos Exporter and other useful tools, and setting bot for Telegram alerting. Can check detail [here](https://github.com/tcnetworkio/monitor.tcnetwork.io).

## 🎁 Staking Service

The first service we are support to Cosmos community is our staking UI. This service allows user/investor not only staking their coin but also tracking on-chain transactions with nice and good performance.

👉 Current we supported Evmos and Rebus chains:

- [Evmos staking](https://evmos.tcnetwork.io)

We will expanding the number of chains we are going to support by time.
