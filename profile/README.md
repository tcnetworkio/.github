## 👨🏻‍🦰 Discord Validator Status Bot

A service that uses the Rest/Rpc(s) registered on-chain, checkings all validators status. When a node goes inactive/active, or missing a number of blocks, or signing block again... The bot sends messages of the corresponding status to the Discord channel.

👉 It allows users to register with their own Discord account(s) on which validator they would like to follow. Then they will be notified only for their validator status!
